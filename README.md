# Week 1: Team Cooler Portfolio Website

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a small portfolio website for our assembled team of developers. We were given some guidance in the form of user stories to fulfill, including: 

* being able to easily view the site on desktop or mobile
* being able to contact our team after navigating the site
* being able to have a similar experience browsing the site if you have accessibility issues

With our user stories in mind, we set out to create a portfolio site that showcased both our individual personalities and team spirit.

And away we go!

## KANJ Design

We wanted our site to have the feel of a design agency, which gave an introduction to us as a group, yet also focused on us as individuals.

It made sense to create a site with a great hero image to draw the user in, then introduce us as a team, and afterwards present the people that make up our 'agency'.

One design decision we made early on was to have a vertical navigation bar, which follows current design conventions while also slightly setting us apart from other sites.

## Design Process

### Day 1

We started out brainstorming in a group together to think about which user stories were most important to us, so we knew what to prioritise.

We wrote our broad goals on the board, ranked them from 1 (most important) to 3 (least important). We also sketched on some paper and agreed on what we all thought the site should broadly look like.

Then we split into pairs, with one creating the HTML skeleton and the other focusing on the CSS skeleton.

By the end of day one, we had a basic grid layout with all of our photos and written content, a basic form, and a basic vertical navigation bar.

### Day 2

At first we stayed in the same pairs as the day before to finish up any work on the HTML or CSS we had floating around in our minds.

Then after a bit we switched up our pairs, focusing on furthering the grid layout and fixing some bugs, or styling the contact form and more with CSS.

Halfway through the morning, we reviewed where we were and set new goals, while also all agreeing on a color palette/font going forward. It felt like the meat and bones of the site was in place, and now we just had to dress it up a bit.

Unfortunately, we wrestled for a long time in the afternoon with creating a mobile layout, which took more time and effort than we expected.

In the end, we finished a mobile layout in time and spent the last hour or so adding a few last bits such as form validation with HTML5, cleaning up our semantic HTML for screen readers, and tweaking some responsive breakpoints.

## Lessons and stretch goals

Perhaps our biggest lesson was in realising that we should not have left mobile to late to work on. In trying to take a desktop layout and switch it to mobile, we found we were creating a lot of 'workarounds' rather than easily taking our HTML and styling it up differently.

If we had more time, we definitely would like to focus on:

* Creating a smoother mobile experience, especially the transition from desktop to tablet to mobile
* Use dev tools to ensure the site was 100% accessibility friendly
* Cleaning up both the HTML and CSS to make it easier to read and make changes to in the future

And that's all from Team Cooler!
