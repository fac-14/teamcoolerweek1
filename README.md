# Week 1: Team Cooler Portfolio Website

## Introduction

## Design Process

* day one
* what is important? What to focus on?
* put our broad goals on board and ranked them 1, 2, 3
* sketched out on paper our main page and all sections, agreed on section names
* one pair did html, one pair did css
* end of day one: basic grid layout with all photos, a basic form, a basic vertical nav bar, and some impsum content
* day two
* stayed in pairs to finish up from day before
* switched pairs: one worked on furthering grid layout and fixing some bugs, other pair did contact form css and some more styling
* did a review all together to set new goals and agree a color palette/font going forward
* looked at mixing grid and flex (OMG) to help vertically align images
* fixed semantic HTML
